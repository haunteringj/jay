> [!The purpose of this project is to provide a machine-learning method that can classify phishing domains.]

The findings made in this project will feature research into how phishing domains are constructed, a literature review of current machine-learning methods that can detect phishing domains, an outline of my method, a discussion of my results, and a discussion of how this project could be applied to other areas of cyber security or other future areas of work.
