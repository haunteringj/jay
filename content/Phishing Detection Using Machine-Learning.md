## **Overview**  
The following note is a heavily summaried paper of my submitted phishing detection project.

This project aims to develop a **machine-learning model** to detect phishing domains by analysing its characteristics. It includes:  
- **Research** into phishing domain construction
- **Implementation** of a Random Forest Classifier  
- **Results** demonstrating high accuracy in identifying malicious domains  
- A **poster presentation** and a **Python-based solution**

## **Key Components**

### 1. **Problem Statement**  
Phishing attacks becoming increasingly prevalent, with billions of hoax emails sent daily. This project explores the **automated detection** of phishing URLs using **Machine Learning (ML)** to address the limitations of heuristic and rule-based methods.

---

### 2. **Research Insights**  
Phishing URLs often exhibit traits such as:  
- Use of **IP addresses** or URL shortening  
- Verbose structures (e.g., long URLs, hyphenated domains)  
- Low traffic, **poor DNS records**, and a **young domain age**  

Machine learning techniques like **Random Forests** and **Support Vector Machines** are explored for classification accuracy.

### 3. **Methodology**  
- **Data Collection**:  
  - **Phishing domains** from public repositories ([Phishing.Database](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Phishing.Database))  
  - **Legitimate domains** from verified internet libraries  
- **Model Development**:  
  - **Supervised Random Forest Classifier** implemented using `scikit-learn` and `Pandas`  
- **Testing and Results**:  
  - Model trained and tested with an imbalanced dataset (higher phishing links)  
  - Focus on precision, recall, and F1-score to assess accuracy

### 4. **Results**  
**Classification Performance**:  
| Class           | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |  
|-----------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|  
| **Legitimate**  | 0.97      | 0.99   | 0.98     | 629     |  
| **Phishing**    | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 5566    |  

- **Accuracy**: 99.5%  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Highlighted dataset bias (9 phishing links for every 1 legitimate link).  

---

### 5. **Challenges & Solutions**  
- **Initial Lack of ML Knowledge**: Resolved through extensive research on phishing detection methods.  
- **Dataset Imbalance**: Addressed by focusing on robust data collection and result analysis.  
- **Biases**: Noticed issues with domain suffixes (e.g., `.au`), leading to false negatives.
